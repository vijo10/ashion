# Ashion

Ashion is a fully functional ecommerce website built using Python and Django backend, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript as the frontend. This project has been created with the intention of helping me gain a better understanding of the Django framework, as my first ecommerce project built using Django, Ashion has been an incredible opportunity for me to learn new concepts and techniques in web development. Throughout the development process, I've learned various concepts and techniques that have enhanced my knowledge in Django.

Ashion is a basic ecommerce website that allows users to browse products, add them to their cart, and complete the checkout process. Users can also create accounts, view their order history, and leave reviews on products.
